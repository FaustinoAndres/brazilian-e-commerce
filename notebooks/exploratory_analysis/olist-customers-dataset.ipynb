`olist_customers_dataset` is related to `olist_orders_dataset` (by providing `customer_id` a FK) and`olist_geolocation_dataset` (through FK: `geolocation_zip_code_prefix`).\n","1. `customer_id` in tables`olist_customers_dataset` and `olist_orders_dataset` are exactly the same: same number of elements and elements themselves. This means that each row in `olist_customers_dataset` actually is a customer ***attached to a single order*** (regardless the status of this order). **See below**\n","2. `customers_unique_id` (currently a FK in this table) is the real unique id of a customer (like registered customers in the ecommerce platform). **See below**\n","\n","~~___From points 1 and 2, we should consider modify this table and (maybe) rename it as `customers_unique` or `registered_customers` where `customers_unique_id` is the PK. Remaining columns could be kept in the same format. This table would be related to `olist_orders_dataset` by `customers_unique_id`.\n","The latter to be more consistent with the theory and good practices.___~~\n","\n","**Finally it is not possible what was proposed above. The number of unique`customer_unique_id` is not the same as number if unique rows. Sometimes the same `customer_unique_id` has different `customer_zip_code_prefix`, which seems to be delivery zip code. TABLE `olist_customers_dataset` is kept in the same original format with the same relationships.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-24T18:29:08.239136Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-24T18:29:08.238832Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-24T18:29:08.243734Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-24T18:29:08.243014Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-24T18:29:08.239104Z"}},"source":["### ***Checking point list 1***"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-31T17:57:32.398715Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-31T17:57:32.398449Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.060621Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.059689Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-31T17:57:32.398683Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["csv_file_name = 'olist_orders_dataset.csv'\n","csv_file_path = os.path.join(dataset_path, csv_file_name)\n","order_df = pd.read_csv(csv_file_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":32,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.062511Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.061879Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.153414Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.152439Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.06246Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["List 1 has 99441 elements\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["['00012a2ce6f8dcda20d059ce98491703',\n"," '000161a058600d5901f007fab4c27140',\n"," '0001fd6190edaaf884bcaf3d49edf079',\n"," '0002414f95344307404f0ace7a26f1d5',\n"," '000379cdec625522490c315e70c7a9fb']"]},"execution_count":32,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["list_1 = order_df['customer_id'].tolist()\n","list_1.sort(key = str)\n","print(f'List 1 has {len(list_1)} elements')\n","list_1[0:5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.155991Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.155694Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.24325Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.242296Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.155957Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["List 2 has 99441 elements\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["['00012a2ce6f8dcda20d059ce98491703',\n"," '000161a058600d5901f007fab4c27140',\n"," '0001fd6190edaaf884bcaf3d49edf079',\n"," '0002414f95344307404f0ace7a26f1d5',\n"," '000379cdec625522490c315e70c7a9fb']"]},"execution_count":33,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["list_2 = df['customer_id'].tolist()\n","list_2.sort(key = str)\n","print(f'List 2 has {len(list_2)} elements')\n","list_2[0:5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.245128Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.244801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.328651Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.327726Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-31T17:57:33.245081Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"execution_count":34,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# customer_id` in tables`olist_customers_dataset` and `olist_orders_dataset` are exactly the same: \n","# same number of elements and elements themselves.
