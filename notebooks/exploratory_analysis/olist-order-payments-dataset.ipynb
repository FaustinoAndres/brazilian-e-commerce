However, `unique_value_count` = 99940 < 99441, meaning some orders in `olist_orders_dataset` are not in `olist_order_payments_dataset`. **Why?** Missing orders in `olist_order_payments_dataset` are not related to any 'order_status' category, they are just missing. We have to agree about what to do here. Maybe, remove these orders from `olist_orders_dataset`. ***ONLY ONE ROW IS MISSING*** **(See
